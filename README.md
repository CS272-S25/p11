# CS472 Group Project

The website we decided to create is an interactive pokemon card store where users can filter/specify the generation of pokemon they are looking for and see all the others from that same generation. 

Targeted towards Pokemon fans, card collectors, and players of the game, this site is perfect for anyone looking to grow their card collection.

Includes all mainline generations of Pokemon. Functionality to search for the desired card, sort by generation, or just browse all available cards at once.
